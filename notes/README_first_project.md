# Production-Ready Subscription Management API

## About This Project

This project is a production-ready backend server designed to manage user subscriptions efficiently. It was built as part of my learning journey into backend development and API architecture. The project focuses on real-world use cases, including user authentication, payment integration, and secure API design.

The code for this project was developed while following the tutorial: "Complete Backend Course | Build and Deploy Your First Production-Ready API". While the core structure comes from the video, I have made modifications and improvements based on my learning experience. But then again, special thanks to **JavaScript Mastery** for creating this valuable resource.

## Features
- **JWT Authentication** for secure user login (and for me to bypass it ðŸ˜„)
- **Database Modeling** to store subscription and user data.
- **Scalable API Architecture** to ensure scalability.
- **Security Best Practices** to protect sensitive data.
- **Real Money Simulated Transactions** for managing subscriptions.

## Why I Built This

I created this project to:

- Learn about backend development with real-world use cases.
  
- Understand how to implement secure authentication and authorization.
  
- Gain experience in building APIs for production environments.
  
- Experiment with database design, API security, and payment integrations.
  
- Showcase my learning progress to friends, teachers, and potential employers.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure that you have:
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
- **MongoDB** setup for database storage.
- A **basic understanding** of backend development concepts.

### Disclaimer

This project is intended for educational purposes only.


## Future Improvements

Improve and making my own API rate limiting and security features instead of just using Arcjet. And adding more features like the missing controllers by my own creativity and also the adminAuth middleware.
