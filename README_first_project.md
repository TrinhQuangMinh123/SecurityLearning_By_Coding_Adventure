# Production-Ready Subscription Management API

## About This Project

This project is a production-ready backend server designed to manage user subscriptions efficiently. It was built as part of my learning journey into backend development and API architecture. The project focuses on real-world use cases, including user authentication, payment integration, and secure API design.

The code for this project was developed while following the tutorial: "Complete Backend Course | Build and Deploy Your First Production-Ready API". While the core structure comes from the video, I have made modifications and improvements based on my learning experience.

## Features

JWT Authentication for secure user login

Database Modeling to store subscription and user data

API Architecture built for scalability

Security Best Practices to protect sensitive data

Automated Workflows for efficient business logic processing

Real Money Transactions for managing subscriptions

## Why I Built This

I created this project to:

Learn about backend development with real-world use cases.

Understand how to implement secure authentication and authorization.

Gain experience in building APIs for production environments.

Experiment with database design, API security, and payment integrations.

Showcase my learning progress to friends, teachers, and potential employers.
