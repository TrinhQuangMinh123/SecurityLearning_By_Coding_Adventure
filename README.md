# Security Learning By Coding Adventure 🔐

I have always dreamed of becoming a security specialist since I was very young.  
This repository is where I document my learning journey through hands-on projects.

## 📌 My Projects
### 1. [First Project: Subscription Management API](notes/README_first_project.md)
This is the first project where I implemented a subscription management and a later hand-made security mesures in mind.

### 2. More projects coming soon!
I'm constantly learning and building new projects. Stay tuned for more projects on security and coding!
